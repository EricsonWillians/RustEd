## 2. Foundations

### 2.1 Procedural Noise and Fractal Techniques

1. **Perlin Noise**  
   - Generates smooth gradients; ideal for organic transitions (e.g., hills, caves).  
2. **Simplex Noise**  
   - More efficient in higher dimensions; fewer artifacts, suitable for multi-parameter layering.  
3. **Fractal Brownian Motion (fBM)**  
   - Stacks multiple noise octaves to produce complex results (e.g., temperature and humidity overlays).

### 2.2 Emergent Structures in DOOM Environments

- **Layered Generation**: Combining different noise maps (terrain, temperature, threat) yields varied yet logically consistent layouts.  
- **Natural vs. Artificial**: Noise introduces unpredictability (natural), while rule-based constraints shape it into DOOM’s architectural forms (artificial).

### 2.3 DOOM-Specific Design Principles

- **Fast Movement & Encounters**: Layouts must encourage “run-and-gun” gameplay.  
- **Spatial Narrative**: Clear signposting via textures and geometry helps players navigate.  
- **Enemy Variety**: Different monsters fill distinct combat roles; place them accordingly.

---

## 3. Philosophical Framework

### 3.1 Controlled Chaos vs. Intentional Structure

- **Chaos for Variety**: Perlin/Simplex noise ensures no two regions look or feel the same.  
- **Constraints as Rails**: Procedural “rules” ensure a playable, intuitive map (e.g., locked doors, key placements, structured rooms).

### 3.2 Spatial Narrative and Symbolic Progression

- **Narrative Flow**: Transition from bases (safe-ish) to toxic sewers (risky) to hellish zones (chaotic) to mirror a descent into danger.  
- **Environmental Symbolism**: Use textures (e.g., **MARBLE**, **BLODGR**, **SKIN** sets) to hint at demonic presence or long-forgotten rituals.

### 3.3 Rhythm of Conflict

- **Combat as Musical Structure**: Tension (ambushes, enclosed areas) followed by release (open arenas, item caches).  
- **Emergent Encounters**: Even within random generation, place triggers near choke points or high-value items to create surprising fights.

### 3.4 Illusion of Hand-Crafted Design

- **Rule-Driven Placement**: Place high-tier enemies/loot together to appear purposeful.  
- **Detailed Texture Work**: Strategic use of specialized textures (e.g., **DOORRED**, **EXITDOOR**) for consistent look-and-feel.

## 4. Biome Generation

### 4.1 Noise-Based Biome Partitioning

1. **Base Terrain Noise**  
   - Generate a 2D array (e.g., 512x512) with Perlin or Simplex noise.  
   - Normalize values to [0, 1] to define thresholds for each biome:  
     - `0.00 - 0.30`: Toxic Sewers  
     - `0.31 - 0.60`: Outdoor Canyon  
     - `0.61 - 0.80`: Tech/Base Areas  
     - `0.81 - 1.00`: Hellish

2. **Additional Noise Layers**  
   - **Temperature**: Distinguish “hot” (lava or infernal) from “cool” (grassland, water).  
   - **Threat**: Higher values yield denser or stronger enemies.

3. **Sub-Biomes and Merging**  
   - Local noise seeds can create sub-biomes (e.g., small pockets of **BROWNHUG** or **CRATE** textures in a primarily metallic zone).

### 4.2 Biome-Specific Architectural Rules

1. **Base/Tech Zones**  
   - Structured corridors and rooms.  
   - Prefab logic for doors, labs, or crate storage areas.  
   - Emphasize metallic or computer-themed textures (e.g., **COMPBLUE**, **COMPTALL**, **TEKWALLx**, **MIDGRATE**).

2. **Hellish Regions**  
   - Jagged, organic forms with lava pools.  
   - Ritualistic altars or demonic architecture.  
   - Preferred textures: **MARBLE**, **BRNPOIS** (poison surfaces), **FIREWALL**, **SKIN** sets for grotesque visuals.

3. **Outdoor Canyons**  
   - Natural cliff geometry, open arenas.  
   - Rock or earthy surfaces (e.g., **ROCKx**, **STONE**, **SLOPPY**, **TANROCK**).  
   - Strategic vantage points for snipers (Chaingunners, Arachnotrons).

4. **Toxic Sewers**  
   - Low lighting, slime floors, cramped tunnels.  
   - Preferring **NUKEPOIS**, **SPOIS** (e.g., **SLADPOIS**) textures and hazards.  
   - Pinky demons or zombies lurking in narrow corridors.

## 5. Encounters & Resource Placement

### 5.1 Enemy Distribution

1. **Density Gradients**  
   - Increase monster strength with distance from start or near key objectives.  
   - Leverage a threat noise map to spike difficulty in “boss-like” rooms.

2. **Enemy Composition Matrix (ECM)**  
   ```text
   Biome: Base/Tech
     Common: ZombieMan, ShotgunGuy
     Uncommon: Chaingunner, Cacodemon
     Rare: Arch-Vile
   Biome: Hellish
     Common: Imp, Demon
     Uncommon: Baron, Pain Elemental
     Rare: Cyberdemon
   ```
3. **Ambush Logic**  
   - Place triggers behind doors or pickups.  
   - BFS/DFS to find player path choke points for maximum surprise.

### 5.2 Resource Allocation

1. **Ammo & Health**  
   - Maintain balance: aim for ~1.2–1.5x the ammo needed for enemies in a sector, adjusted by difficulty.  
   - Health packs near difficult encounters, but not to trivialize them.

2. **Key & Switch Placement**  
   - Main path locks: Red/Blue/Yellow key usage.  
   - Off-path secrets: Hidden switches, false walls using **WOODMET** or **STONE5** to hint at a breakable boundary.

3. **Secrets & Rewards**  
   - Mimic DOOM’s signature secrets with subtle texture alignment cues (e.g., a misaligned **STARTAN** tile).

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Data Structures & Algorithms

1. **Grid Representation**  
   - 2D array `Array2D<Tile>` storing tile type, biome ID, and texture reference.  
2. **Noise Generation**  
   - Use [**noise**](https://crates.io/crates/noise) crate in Rust for Perlin/Simplex/fBM.  
3. **Procedural Pipeline**  
   1. **Generate** noise layers  
   2. **Classify** cells into biomes  
   3. **Construct** geometry (rooms, corridors, caves)  
   4. **Place** enemies, items, keys  
   5. **Apply** textures (Section 6.2)  
   6. **Validate** connectivity and balance

### 6.2 Texture Usage and Classification

One of the most critical aspects of crafting an immersive DOOM experience is **proper texture usage**. The following table outlines a **high-level classification** scheme, helping you select textures that align with each biome’s mood and gameplay function. The full texture list provided (over **300** textures) can be used as a resource pool; below are **sample groupings** to guide procedural assignment:

| **Category**          | **Texture Prefixes / Examples**                  | **Typical Biome**         | **Notes**                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Base / Tech**       | `COMP*`, `TEK*`, `MID*`, `SHAWN*`, `STARTAN*`, `CRATE*` | Tech Zones                | Metal walls, computer panels, crates, clean or industrial vibe                                     |
| **Hellish / Demonic** | `MARB*`, `BLOD*`, `SKIN*`, `FIRE*`, `ROCKRED*`, `BRNPOIS*` | Hellish Regions           | Flesh, blood, infernal runes, bone, fire textures, poison floors                                   |
| **Outdoor / Rock**    | `ROCK*`, `STONE*`, `SLOPPY*`, `TANROCK*`, `BROWN*`      | Outdoor Canyons           | Natural cliff faces, desert-like or mountainous surfaces                                           |
| **Toxic / Slime**     | `NUKE*`, `SLAD*`, `GST*`, `POIS*`               | Toxic Sewers / Hazards    | Corrosive slime floors and walls, suitable for hazard-filled sewers or chemical plants             |
| **Doors**             | `DOOR*`, `BIGDOOR*`, `SPCDOOR*`, `ZDOOR*`, `EXITDOOR`   | Any Biome (functional)    | Door textures used in transitions between areas; color-coded for key-based locks (e.g. `DOORBLU`)   |
| **Switches**          | `SW1*`, `SW2*`                                   | All Biomes                | Switch textures for interactive elements, color-coded or themed (blue, brown, skull, etc.)         |
| **Support / Trim**    | `SUPPORT*`, `PIPE*`, `LITE*`, `METAL*`, `WOOD*` | All Biomes (decoration)   | Structural columns, piping, lighting, metallic or wooden supports that add realism                 |
| **Decor / Misc**      | `SKY*`, `PLANET*`, `SP_*`, `ZZ*`                | Ambient or Thematic       | Sky textures (`SKY1`, `SKY2`), decorative surfaces, special signage or Easter eggs (like `SP_DUDE`)|

**Implementation Notes**:

1. **Texture Selection Algorithm**  
   - Once a cell is assigned a biome, filter the texture list by category.  
   - Randomly sample from the filtered set to avoid repetition.  
   - For special surfaces (doors, switches), pick from relevant DOOR/SW or custom sets.  

2. **Transitions Between Biomes**  
   - Blend textures near biome boundaries (e.g., mixing `ROCK*` with `METAL*` in transitional corridors).  
   - Slight randomization for offset or alignment to mimic DOOM’s hand-crafted quirks.

3. **Lighting & Variation**  
   - Use `LITE*` textures or brightness offsets to highlight paths, key areas, or secret regions.  
   - Keep certain areas intentionally dark to foster tension (especially in hellish or toxic zones).

### 6.3 Performance & Optimization

- **Parallel Generation**: Use Rust’s concurrency model to generate different biome segments simultaneously.  
- **Spatial Indexing**: Octrees or quadtrees for quickly querying collisions, connectivity, or pathfinding.  
- **Texture Caching**: Avoid repeated file I/O by loading frequently used textures (like `STARTAN*`, `DOORTRAK`) into memory once.

---

## 7. Testing & Validation

### 7.1 Automated Testing

1. **Connectivity Tests**  
   - Validate that all keys, switches, and the map exit are reachable (pathfinding: A* or BFS).  
2. **Difficulty Curves**  
   - Track total enemy health vs. total ammo to ensure the map is challenging but not impossible.  

### 7.2 Playtesting and Iteration

1. **Manual Playtesting**  
   - Gather feedback on texture variety, biome transitions, and overall “fun factor.”  
2. **Data-Driven Iteration**  
   - Use logs to collect average player damage taken, time spent in each biome, or frequency of secrets found.

## 8. Conclusion & Future Directions

By combining **noise-driven** biome generation, **philosophical design** principles, and **robust texture usage**, RustEd DOOM Map Editor can produce **dynamic** and **immersive** levels that feel both fresh and authentically DOOM-like. The texture list provided offers a vast palette for theming and **environmental storytelling**. Key areas for future research and improvement include:

1. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Dynamically adjust spawns or resources based on real-time player performance.  
2. **Machine Learning for Map Aesthetics**: Use player feedback to train ML models that guide texture/biodome selection.  
3. **Advanced Geometry Variation**: Add vertical layering, multi-floor structures, and more intricate prefab sets.  

With this guide, developers can systematically build and refine a **procedurally generated DOOM environment** that leverages the extensive texture assets while maintaining the frenetic, atmospheric essence that defines DOOM gameplay.
